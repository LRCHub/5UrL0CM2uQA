I was sittin' in a breakfast room in allentown, pennsylvania, six o'clock in the morning, got up to early, it was a terrible mistake... sittin' there face-to-face with a 75 cent glass of orange
About as big as my finger and a bowl of horribly foreshortened cornflakes, and I said to myself: "this is the life!"...

She's 200 years old,
So mean, she couldn't grow no lips
Boy, she'd be in trouble if she tried to grow a mustache

She's two hundred years old
Squattin' down & pockin' up
In front of the juke box
Just like she had true religion. boy!

She's two hundred years old
Hoy!, hoy!, in 200 years,
Half of this, none of that,
One. fifty. oh squattin',
Yeah-ah, ain't she got
Oohhh, she got religion now, boy.

Oohhhh,??????
Oohhhh, she's just mean,
She just, she just can't grow no lips.
Squat. down, so mean she can't grow no lips.
200 years old, so mean she can't grow no lips.
